## Introduction

Hello, my name is Matheus Passos. I am a fullstack intern and a computer engineering student at UTFPR, Brazil. In this project, I have created a simple calculator application using basic concepts of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Vue.js 2.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Responsive Design:** The calculator's layout is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on various screen sizes.

3. **Clear Functionality:** There's a "C" button to clear the current input or reset the calculator.

4. **Decimal Handling:** The calculator allows input and display of decimal numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used to structure the calculator's layout and buttons.
  
- **CSS:** Styled the calculator components for a visually appealing user interface.
  
- **JavaScript:** Implemented the calculator's functionality and mathematical operations.
  
- **Vue.js 2:** Used to create dynamic and interactive components, making the calculator responsive without full page reloads. Quasar framework included.
